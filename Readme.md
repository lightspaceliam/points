# Points

This will be my 1st attempt at working with Python 3^. I have a work related task of: 

1.	Reading a considerable amount of data that has accumulated over the course of 12 months from a Microsoft database
2.	Performing minor calculations
3.	Exporting results to a .csv file

To make this task more challenging I have chosen to build this in Python to see if I could transfer my .NET skills over to Python, including concepts such as OOP(Object Oriented Programming), inheritance and more. Iâ€™m sure there will be lots of refactoring as I pick up how the Python folk do things. Please keep in mind, this is my 1st attempt at writing anything more than just a hello world application in Python, so go easy on the judgement ;-D.
